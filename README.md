## Bike-Rental Regression

# Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating regression models to predict the number of bike rentals based on various features such as weather conditions, time, and user demographics. The goal is to understand the key factors influencing bike rental demand and provide accurate predictions to optimize operations for bike rental services.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into the dataset using visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Regression Models**: Implementing and comparing various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Utilize a bike rental dataset (e.g., [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) or Kaggle).
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Scale numerical data
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand relationships between variables
   - Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
4. **Model Development**:
   - Train multiple regression models
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning
   - Select the best-performing model
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Test the model on unseen data
   - Analyze residuals and performance metrics
6. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize key findings
   - Provide recommendations based on model insights
